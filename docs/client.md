# Tantalim Client

## Client Dependencies

The Tantalim Client is written in AngularJS, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Along with the Client code, it also uses:

* [wrapper index page generated by the Tantalim server](server/#wrapper-index)
* [partials generated by the Tantalim server](server/#partials)
* [Model data queried from Tantalim models](models/#data).
* [Page definitions](pages/#page-definition)

### Libraries

Tantalum Client uses several 3rd party dependencies. These are managed by Bower.

* AngularJS
* Bootstrap
* LoDash
* Mobile Angular UI


## AngularJS Classes



### ModelCursor
Part of `tantalim.common` the `ModelCursor` is created with a Model and a data set. It has two main jobs:

* Remember which records have been inserted, updated, and deleted
* Track which row is currently selected

Keeping track of the structure of the data model and navigating up, down and sideways can get complex. The ModelCursor
takes care of all of that complexity.

### Desktop PageCursor

Part of `tantalim.desktop` the `PageCursor` is created from a [Page definition](pages/#page-definition) and is
responsible for tracking the page views.

TODO: keep track of view is currently selected.

### Desktop PageController

Part of `tantalim.desktop` the `PageController` is the starting point for desktop single page apps. It uses `$scope`,
`PageCursor`, `ModelCursor`, and more to handle most of the business logic.

### Mobile PageController

Part of `tantalim.mobile` the `PageController` is the starting point for mobile single page apps.

### Select Directive

Tantalim uses a custom fork of [ui-select](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-select) with a Bootstrap theme. This
[directive](https://github.com/tantalim/tantalim-client/tree/master/public/select)
includes custom changes to support `ModelCursor`.
