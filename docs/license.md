# Tantalim License

## Commercial License

This is the appropriate option if you want to use Ext JS to develop commercial applications whose source code you want
to keep proprietary.

Commercial licenses will soon be available. Pricing is negotiable for early adopters.

## Open Source License

Tantalim is an avid supporter of open source software. Our open source license is the appropriate option if you are
creating an open source application under a license compatible with the
[GNU GPL license v3](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html). Although the GPLv3 has many terms, the most important is
that you must provide the source code of your application to your users so they can be free to modify your application
for their own needs.
