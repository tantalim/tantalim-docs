# Tantalim Client

## Client Dependencies

The Tantalim Client is written in AngularJS, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Along with the Client code, it also uses:

* [wrapper index page generated by the Tantalim server](server/#wrapper-index)
* [partials generated by the Tantalim server](server/#partials)
* [Model data queried from Tantalim models](models/#data).
* [Page definitions](pages/#page-definition)

### Libraries

Tantalum Client uses several 3rd party dependencies. These are managed by Bower.

* AngularJS
* Bootstrap
* LoDash
* Mobile Angular UI


## AngularJS Classes

### [ModelCursor](client/model-cursor)

### Desktop PageCursor

Part of `tantalim.desktop` the `PageCursor` is created from a [Page definition](pages/#page-definition) and is
responsible for tracking the page views.

TODO: keep track of view is currently selected.

### Desktop PageController

Part of `tantalim.desktop` the `PageController` is the starting point for desktop single page apps. It uses `$scope`,
`PageCursor`, `ModelCursor`, and more to handle most of the business logic.

`listSmartSelect` is a map of server data used for each select option.

### Mobile PageController

Part of `tantalim.mobile` the `PageController` is the starting point for mobile single page apps.

### Select Directive

Tantalim uses a custom fork of [ui-select](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-select) with a Bootstrap theme. This
[directive](https://github.com/tantalim/tantalim-client/tree/master/public/select)
includes custom changes to support `ModelCursor`.
